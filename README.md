### Tuff Golem
This handsome guy can be found in its Temple, which generates in Jungle Biomes. It has a love for showcasing items given to it. Once it receives something, it stays in place, proudly displaying the item. While holding its treasure, the Tuff Golem becomes invulnerable, making it a steadfast protector of whatever it treasures. You can even change its clothing color by giving it a wool or moss carpet, adding a personal touch to its look while it stands guard over its treasure.

### Copper Golem
The Copper Golem is a unique protector that sometimes get spawned by villagers instead of an Iron Golem. It also has a chance to appear in the added Copper Forge Structure. While it shares the role of protecting villagers like the Iron Golem, the Copper Golem is not as strong or durable. As it walks, it occasionally oxidizes copper blocks beneath its feet. Additionally, the Copper Golem turns copper bulbs on or off depending on the time of day when stepping on them.

### Glare
A mysterious creature that spawns in Lush Caves, casting a soft glow that illuminates its surroundings. Villagers find it a bit spooky, almost ghostlike, and often warn their golems about it. Despite its eerie appearance, the Glare is harmless and simply adds a touch of light to the caves. A pale variant of the Glare can also be found in the Pale Garden Biome.

### Penguin
A clumsy and playful creature found in the Snowy Plains, Ice Spikes, and Frozen or Deep Frozen Ocean Biomes. It loves to skate on ice, moving much faster than you'd expect for such a little guy. Penguins are especially fond of Raw Cod, and feeding one makes it incredibly happy. In return, it will give you an Ice or Snow-related item as a thank you.

### Bloomer
A new variant of the Creeper, still just as scary, but with a twist. Instead of causing a destructive explosion, when it detonates, it creates a moss patch where it stood. In a way, the Bloomer sacrifices itself to beautify its surroundings, leaving a peaceful touch of greenery behind in place of the usual destruction.

### Nautilus Crab
A fascinating creature found in six different variants on beaches. These crabs have a unique habit of burying ocean-related items in the sand whenever they feel like it. With a little patience, you can "brush" out these hidden treasures, which might include a rare item, the Nautilus Horn. When played, the Nautilus Horn produces a special sound that summons a Pufftail, adding a magical touch to your beachside adventures. You never know what treasures they might hide beneath the sand!

### Rat
A small, fast creature that spawns in most grassy biomes, except for Snowy Plains, Meadows, Mangrove Swamps, and Pale Gardens. With five different variants, these little creatures are always on the move. Rats have a particular fondness for Rotten Flesh, which they nibble on whenever they can. In return for feeding them, Rats might even hand you a piece of Cheese as a thank you, making them quirky and somewhat useful companions in the wild.

### Snail
A slow-moving creature found in most forest biomes, with 9 different variants to discover. These little creatures have a unique defense mechanism‚Äîthey are afraid of Arthropods! Whenever an Arthropod comes too close, the Snail retreats into its shell, leaving behind a slimy trail cloud. This trail not only slows down anything that crosses it but also gives the Oozing effect, causing creatures to be covered in gooey slime.

### Cruncher
A mob that lives in the Badlands biome. It loves to eat ore blocks, and when it does, it spits out a cobbled stone/deepslate. It's fire-resistant and doesn‚Äôt take fall damage, so it can survive tough environments. If you hit it, the Cruncher will drop the ores it ate, giving you a chance to get them back. It‚Äôs a weird but useful creature to find in the Badlands!
