## Fixes:
- removed info dialog
- moved files from eden namespace to nice_mobs
- removed Copper Golem due to Mojang adding it (Existing Copper Golems get automatically removed)
- reworked mob update functions
- reduced view_range of custom mobs
- custom mobs now only play most of their animations if a player is within 32 blocks to save up on performance
